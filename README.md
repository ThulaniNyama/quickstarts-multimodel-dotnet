# multimodel-dotnet-quickstart

The QuickStart can be found at [https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Multimodel](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Multimodel)
It shows object, relational, and native access from a .NET application to InterSystems IRIS. 
Airport data is stored using objects, retrieved using SQL, and a custom data structure is created using the Native API to handle route information between airports.

## How to run:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the `quickstarts-multimodel-dotnet.sln` in Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. In `multimodelQS.cs` file, change username, password, IP, port and namespace to point to your instance of InterSystems IRIS.
4. Uncomment the following two lines and run code to see objects and SQL working side-by-side:
`// storeAirfare(irisNative);`  
`// checkAirfare(irisNative);` 
 
**NOTE:** We recommend to use **Microsoft Visual Studio** to run .NET Multimodel QuickStart code. If you do not have **Microsoft Visual Studio**, please use our Learning Labs to experience the .NET Multimodel QuickStart.
